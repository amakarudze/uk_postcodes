## Ground rules & expectations
Before you get started, here are a few things I expect from you:

* Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project.
* If you open a pull request, please ensure that your contribution passes all tests. If there are test failures, you 
will need to address them before I can merge your contribution.
    
## How to contribute
* If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the issues and pull requests to see whether someone else has 
raised a similar idea or question.
* If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this project, do one of the following:
    * If your contribution is minor, such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
    * If your contribution is major, such as a new way of implementing the code, start by opening an issue first. 
    That way, I can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.

## Style guide
If you're writing content, see the [PEP8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) to help your prose 
match the rest of the Guides.

## Setting up your environment
* Fork the repo and clone it.
* Create a new `virtualenv` and install requirements. The project has very few dependent libraries.
